- Upload parsed MT940 and ledger CSV files
- Generate pairwise combinations of transactions
- Match using:
  - Amount difference
  - Date difference
  - Debit/Credit mirror
  - Reference and narration match
- Train a Random Forest model to predict likely matches
- Interactive dashboard with three tabs:
  - üîç High Confidence Matches (Prediction > 90%)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium/Low Confidence Matches (Prediction < 90%)
  - üîÅ 1-to-Many Candidates
- Filters for confidence, amount/date difference, references, and narration
- Downloadable outputs for each view
